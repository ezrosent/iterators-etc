This branch has been created for testing.

Run the makefile before running anything else. Bench.java runs code for one test; specify input parameters via command line arguments.
runTests.py runs several tests and writes all results to an output file. run.sh does everyything: it compiles the Java code,
runs runTests.py, then runs a gnuplot script to plot the gathered data.
